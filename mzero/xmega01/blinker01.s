;;USART initialization should use the following sequence:
;;1. Set the TxD pin value high, and optionally the XCK pin low.
;;2. Set the TxD and optionally the XCK pin as output.
;;3. Set the baud rate and frame format.
;;4. Set mode of operation (enables the XCK pin output in synchronous mode).
;;5. Enable the Transmitter or the Receiver depending on the usage.
;;For interrupt driven USART operation, global interrupts should be disabled during the
;;initialization
