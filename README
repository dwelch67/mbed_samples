This is a collection of sample programs, in some respects building
on each other for the mbed (http://mbed.org) platform.

These samples are intended to demonstrate how to use the platform
without using the web compiler or mbed api.  This will hopefully
get you kick started into learning to program the hardware directly
using the reference material provided by the vendor(s).

At a minimum you will need some documents, starting at

http://mbed.org

go to the handbook page (Handbook link top right of page)

http://mbed.org/handbook

At the bottom of the page (before the comments start) go to the
hardware page (mbed NXP LPC1768 link)

http://mbed.org/handbook/mbed-NXP-LPC1768

Near the bottom of that page are two documents you need, first
is the schematic

http://mbed.org/media/uploads/chris/mbed-005.1.pdf

The second is the LPC1768 users manual

Start with the blinker programs, blinker01, blinker02, blinker03, etc.
